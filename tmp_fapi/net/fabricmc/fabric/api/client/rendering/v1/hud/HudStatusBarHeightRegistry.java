/**
 * A registry for {@link StatusBarHeightProvider} instances, known as height providers. These providers define the
 * vertical space occupied by HUD elements, known as status bars, which are positioned on the left and right sides above
 * the player's hotbar.
 *
 * <p>Registering a height provider allows the game to automatically adjust the layout of existing HUD elements,
 * including vanilla ones, to accommodate new bars without overlap. The system calculates the cumulative height from
 * registered providers on each side and shifts status bars like health, armor, food, and air bars accordingly.
 *
 * <p>Height providers are associated with an {@link class_2960}. The function itself should return the height of the
 * custom bar. The identifier must also be registered with a corresponding {@link HudElement} in
 * {@link HudElementRegistry}. The relative positioning to other HUD elements is determined from that registration. For
 * instance, registering a height provider for a HUD element attached before
 * {@link VanillaHudElements#ARMOR_BAR ARMOR_BAR} via {@link #addLeft(class_2960, StatusBarHeightProvider)} implies the
 * custom bar is on the left side and affects the vertical positioning of elements starting from the armor bar upwards.
 *
 * <p>The final vertical offset for a HUD element is determined by summing the heights of all custom providers
 * registered for elements that would appear "below" it on the same side. This includes all HUD elements that have been
 * attached before it in {@link HudElementRegistry}.
 *
 * <p>Mods that would otherwise have a mixin for altering a vanilla status bar are encouraged to instead register a
 * full replacement via {@link HudElementRegistry} and this class.
 *
 * <p>For vanilla HUD element identifiers, see {@link VanillaHudElements}.
