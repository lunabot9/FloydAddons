	 * The {@code VertexConsumerProvider} instance being used by the world renderer for most non-terrain renders.
	 * Generally this will be better for most use cases because quads for the same layer can be buffered
	 * incrementally and then drawn all at once by the world renderer.
	 *
	 * <p>IMPORTANT - all vertex coordinates sent to consumers should be relative to the camera to
	 * be consistent with other quads emitted by the world renderer and other mods.  If this isn't
	 * possible, caller should use a separate "immediate" instance.
	 *
	 * <p>Renders that cannot draw in one of the supported events must be drawn directly to the frame buffer,
	 * preferably in {@link WorldRenderEvents#END_MAIN} to avoid being overdrawn or cleared.
